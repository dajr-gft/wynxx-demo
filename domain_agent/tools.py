"""Domain operations exposed as ADK function tools.

ADK builds each tool's schema from the function name, type hints and docstring,
so keep all three accurate. Conventions (per the ADK 2.0 docs):
- Type-hint every parameter; omit defaults for values the model must supply.
- Return a ``dict`` with a ``status`` key ("success" | "error").
- In a generated agent, each legacy use-case / public service method becomes one
  typed function here, wired to the modernized domain logic.
